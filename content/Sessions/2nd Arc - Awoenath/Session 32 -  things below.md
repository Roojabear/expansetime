**We Did a bunch of things.**
 
- Beat up Skahl. (gave him alive to the Golden Guardians)
 
- Saw the extermination lab (Took the Mist Artifact)
 
- Heard about father Astarov. (found his base of operations, the imbetween on the masts)
 
- Made a trade deal to control minervas den (293s)
 
On the masts at the wayward compass, Met Bryar and Chungle-down Bim. Used it as a base to scout out strange happenstance.  
Learnt lots about the plunder pact. Pirate lords and such.
