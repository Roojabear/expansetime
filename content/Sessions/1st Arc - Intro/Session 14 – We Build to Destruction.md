West cross is held, the party is split.
   

**Gorlath and Slate**
 
- In the chambers of the Masks, they will be forced to bring the acolytes of the archon to the chamber and help sacrifice them to It That Watches.
- They are outnumbered and out gunned.
- It is more persuasive than brute force.
   

**Enfield and Paddy**
 
- Smoke bomb – choose where to go
- Novella plant will be pretty shut down and lead to the depths of the city Aswell.
- Something else will be watching them. (William Boyle)
- Batman somewhere.
- They will find Callus Treadwell, satyr about 40 ish by this point – still housing the secrets of novella core.
- The "Plant" ships it down to him where he uses scribe magic to encase the cores – this alongside the metal with karak blood and electric conductivity creates a version of the scribes magik that allows for pure unadulterated power.
- The reason for "atarac disruptions" is due to the conflict in the weave and scribes magiks.
- He has a tome of the first scribe.
    
**Seamus and Korin/Segert**
 
- Korin is going through it in his room
- Seamus to deal with Fredrick his guard and help Segert.
- Who will turn and use "Handler" to end those that know.
- This will be beaten out of him.
- He will still feel the tugs but regain himself.
- Fred might relent and tell them what he thinks is going on.
- Or batman will kick down the door and help.
   
**Scribes**
   
- **Shelin, described as the first scribe**, details how to write in runic, laying the foundations for runic magic. A chapter has been lost with time, some speculate that Shelin predicted the weave in something called the shelin prophecy - **Opan, sister of shelin, the second scribe,** known to be the founder of evocation, a mixture of runic magic and paganistic ritual. Said to have never cast magic herself, only taught others how to cast from writing. - **Ibis, Third scrib**e, developed the ability to quickly cast from books or written text through rigorous training and development of the unconscious ability to cast, also known to have developed both illusion and mind magics. - **Ezin, the fourth scribe**, the youngest depicted scribe, shown to never age past their teens, developed tattoo magic, casting runic magic from the skin and developing the rest of the magical repertoire used today. - **The fifth scribe,** there are simply murals, lost to time is the name and any details surrounding this scribe.           
**Callus**
   
- The novella core was founded as Callus connected with the lost chapter of Shelins script, not being able to read he simply brought Shelins constructions to life, ultimately making a portable new power.
- Inside each novella core is a distillation and crystallization of writings, an ancient saying by shelin that gives the cores power, this is also a saying of life, capable of healing and bringing in new life.
- Callus in truth wanted nothing to do with the revolution, only a tinkerer who wanted to bring the scribes' work to life, but misinterpreted the scale of Shelins designs.
- Once the revolution ended he was actually hidden by the technocratic union and still designs the Novella Cores, under their strict guidance.
