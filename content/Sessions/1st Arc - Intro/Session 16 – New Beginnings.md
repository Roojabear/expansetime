We arrive on titan
 - At the age of 25 when his training was complete he was given leadership of a sect, **Dhìochuimhnich Mi** (I forgot)
- This is a Small uninhabited island off the northern coast of **Shorati**.
- The sect mostly collects information and the **Shorati** and **Scgand** governments, and performs hits where necessary to keep the continent in line with **Marthra**’s ideals.
- Received a message from his **handler** who is unknown to him but is identifiable by their unique encoding system.
- The message is about the discovery of **Awoenath, the convergence**, and the potential for interplanetary travel.
- The **Al Demera** are the source of this information and the job requires infiltration by Segert himself.
- To ensure everything went smoothly, Segert created a personality which would infiltrate the Al Demera under his guidance but with no knowledge of the Cult of Marthra. 
**Dhìochuimhnich Mi**  
**Small Island**
 - Beach with large cliffs surrounding, Then a plains plateau with many opening gathering spaces.
- Handler has arrived to take over the operation due to Segerts incompetence.
- He is here to bring his own personality to the front of Segerts mind.
- Needs to complete the ritual to do so.
- Will lambast Segert for his incompetence and call him the most pathetic of Mathra's chosen.
- Will then try split his minds in two so that Segert can return to normal.
- Will give him a chance to communicate to the goddess before his ritual. 
**Will poison the party through food.**
 - 24 hours to kick in. 
**Gorlath will receive communication from the Voice of the Yggdrasil.**
 - Where you at bud.
- I'm on my way.
- Will take them to a port city when all is over. 
**If toby looks up the expanse fragment will gravitate towards the citadel in the sky**.
