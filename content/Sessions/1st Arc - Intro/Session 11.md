Turning point
 
**Goals**
 
- Punch Finn into the spotlight, through using his backstory
- Simultaneously bring the idea, of he who watches.
   

**It That Watches**
 
- The grand architect, The banished, It That watches. - The Creator of the weave and the original god.
   

- Currently plotting his revenge on those who sealed him away long ago.
 
**Keeper (Wilson)**
 
- Posed as an academic in halls of whispers, working on repairing the Eluvian. (elvish for looking glass) - In truth is a bald woman, a keeper, who was tasked with exploring the Eluvian only to end up here, her amulet of Mathra holds skin and allows her to take the visage of another.
   

- She refuses to let Korin see what is in the room, will do whatever it takes to keep the secret.
 
- has been leaking research to the Baron in order to stoke fires and keep Sadri's ire elsewhere, needs her to forget about the Eluvian and never discover its signifigance.  
**The academy of whispers.**
 
- A place of grand research and development for the greatest minds of the core city's.
- Framed like a huge RND space with levels dedicated to what you can achieve.
- First level is literally 2 bits of metal – prove yourself - Down is more research layers, up is Sadri's chosen.
   

- Brutalist architecture – new building, function over form.
 
- The mages are kept above. All but Enfield's sister.
   

**Professor** **François Lardin**
 
- is in the academy and is currently trying to help the mages escape.
- Similar to Sadri – tools for a goal, but cares about the mages.
- Used patty will do so again.
