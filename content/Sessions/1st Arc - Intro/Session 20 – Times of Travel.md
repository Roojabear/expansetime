Paddy we made it to Kanaka, but things aren't good, thief king has lost his son and the city is denying entry to refugees.
 
- Rasheed golden wind.
 
I have your message, hope this reaches you, I am currently in the city of golden sin, I have an expanse fragment also, please let me see yours.
 
**Boat travel**
 
- A few days, running out of supplies eventually.
- Nights are treacherous, things attack if they do not pay gold to N'vrata.
- Need money and supplies,
 
**Old Perlican**
 
- Stop at a fishing village that was devastated by the war.
- People are still rebuilding, local forest has been stripped for wood.
- Not a lot of trade.
- Some paladins from the church have set up a barricade round the city and are helping with repairs, some branded others not. Fear of raiders from the north coming further down.
 
**The Mayor** **Arjhan.**
 
- ==He is a Superstitious man, concerned with the oldest house connecting it with the sins of their god.==
- If you cleanse The oldest House, we will give you 100 gold.
- Hunt a corrupted beast that lurks near our waters, disrupting trade also 100 gold.
 
**The Oldest House**
 
- Said to be protected by the god himself, was used as a safehouse during the war.
- Pelors Magic was used to keep them at bay.
- But people were lost during the weeks they stayed inside, its halls twist and are labyrinth.
- When Pelors sin was complete the house allowed them out.
- A few have entered since but none have returned.
- Local residents speak of the bagman, a creature of myth that captures the young in its bag of holding since being lost in the oldest house.
 
**Trickery, madness, defiance**
 
- A conduit who has long evaded the gods ire, simply existing for ages past.
- He protected this place during the inquisition for a small bit of fun.
- Same reason he now torments it.
- Will have a thin Wiley creature use a bag of holding to capture people and things.
 
**The beast of the Dead-fire**
 
- The Dead-fire Archipelago has been difficult to travel for a while now.
- Nvaratas brood seems to attack ships that do not pay tolls to the depths.
- An abolish and its skum sits close to the coast and will attack the party as they near the port.
- The party will have to dive into an air pocket and fight the beast in their lair.
- They will find men controlling the beast to ransom ships.
 
Either fight.
