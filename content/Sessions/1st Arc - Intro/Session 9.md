**and be sent thanks by Six**
 
Friends,
 
I cannot thank you enough for your help in Colmere, you saved both mina and I's life. I promise to repay you if I ever get the chance.  
As promised, here are the experimental designs for the Augmented Exoskeleton General Industrial Suit or A.E.G.I.S along with my theorized stabilization serum. We will be in Serkonis shortly all going well.
 
If i find William I will tell him his son is a fine man.
 
Yours faithfully,  
Six

Steal plans from the academy of the place.
 
Can enlist Gono's help, THE SABINI to unlock the side doors.  
Or  
Kill Gono for the black knives and they will find you a way in.

Or  
Simply use them as a distraction.
