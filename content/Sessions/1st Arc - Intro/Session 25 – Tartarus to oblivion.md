The city fall

- Everart Sinclair, is dying and happy that his machine is working
- Noah has started to split the soul well with the help of the _raven queen,_ his and Salems brother.
- The Animus containers are cracking throughout the city, the machine reverberates with force. Everything begins to fall apart. The city floods.
   

**THE ANIMUS MACHINE**
 
- **Is far beyond your comprehension**
- Needs a 30 total before he can begin to work on it with the scribes.
- Keeping Everart alive may help in this working out of the machine.
   

**The soul well**
 
- The party does not have long before the well is completely cracked
- They will need to ascend the mount and slow down Noah.
- Peach's mother will be doing the soul cracking.
 
Soul beasts
 
15hp  
6 damage but there are lots of them.  
Dying will also create more souls to go wild, so maybe be non-lethal.
