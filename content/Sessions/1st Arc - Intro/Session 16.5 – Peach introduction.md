**Personal stuff**  
You are a Dark elf/Drow around 24 years of age.
 
Your earliest memories consist of lush greenery and you mothers blackened eyes amongst them.  
In these days you first began to hear whispers of others attempting to control you.  
It was only your mother who was able to calm the shouts and screams in your head.  
However the first inquisition came, forcing you to flee with your father, leaving your mother behind.  
From then on you had to cope with the otherworldly presence in your head, struggling to maintain control of your own thoughts.  
Eventually you turned to music to drown out the voices.  
Since them you became a self-trained Bard who has lived a survivalists life in the northern wastes of Olothyr for most of your days upon titan.  
Until your father died recently, leaving you clues as to where your mother might be.
 
**His note read**
 
_Son, I apologize for the deceptions but it was her wish to keep you safe. However as I pass into the wheel I know your connection to the goddess will bind you to her mad fate regardless of my silence, so consider this divulgence a forced gesture of love for fear of another's words corrupting you. She seeks places called Soul wells, wherever and whatever they may be._ _I have suspicion enough to believe one is in Shorati, hidden amongst the leaves of the Ygdrasil, hopefully you will find her there._
 
_Give her my love son, be safe._
 
Since your fathers passing your voices have gotten louder and you had a direct connection with the goddess herself.  
However brief it was she commanded you to seek a god woken of hers who has defied her and seeks to bring ruin to her realm. She wishes for you to find them for her and in exchange will grant you a boon of hers.  
As of now you have been travelling the seas and lands to reach the Ygdrasil in Elysium whilst keeping a look out for this god woken of the raven queen.
