**Enfield**

- My dearest son
 
I am heartbroken to hear of the suffering in Frenin, those people have already been through so much if only we could do more.  
On the bright side some nice men have been stopping by bringing us food. Sometimes they stay and speak to your sister about you, it's all very nice. I think they said something about Sadri.
 
Hope to see you home soon.  
Love, Mom.
