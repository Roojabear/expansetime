**BACKSTORY**
 
You come from a place called the aspen wilds, where nomadic tribes wander the wood, hills and plains ignoring hating old mage regime and current technocratic union.
 
You left for whatever reasons. Could be boredom or wanting beers and hookers but either way you ended up in MARTIPPES.
 
Needing coin You have been hired by Sadri's advisor **Seneschal Vram** to rid the sewer system of "rat like creatures"
 
You and 3 others ventured in and none have survived apart from you, who is still killing rats 2 days later.
 
You start on 38hp killing a rat.
