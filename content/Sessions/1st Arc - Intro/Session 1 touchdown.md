**It begins**
 
Three years ago your worlds changed.
 
The convergence occurred, warping the cosmos and the expanse there within to bring planets closer.  
A bright purple radiance now scorches across the sky, a constant reminder of the forces otherworldly lie in wait.
 
All of you can feel changes in the air, the weave flows now through all worlds.
