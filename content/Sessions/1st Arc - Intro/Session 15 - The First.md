**What shall we do with all this death**

- Flash back, what was Slate thinking/doing
- What was Enfield thinking/ doing
- What was Fredrick thinking/doing.
   

As blades fly and scythes are pulled, what will happen.
    
**Oliver –** Your brother
 - Age: 49
- He is thin and wily, reaching about 6'4, his lanky form often loomed over you as a kid.
- You last saw him 3 years ago at your father's funeral where he said he would not be around for a while as he had been given an important promotion within the Ministery of Technocratic affairs.
- He was a heavy believer of the technocrats ideals, going so far as to leading a sect of revolutionists early into the revolts.
- You remember him stealing a coin pouch from a Aciem Nobel and getting beat for it, so that you could afford a stuffed toy to help you sleep. 
**Avery –** Your sister.
 - Age:35
- She is tall and athletic looking sitting at about 6'0, she was always faster than you.
- Avery lives with your elderly mother, tending to her since Oliver left.
- She left her job 3 years ago to be a full time career for your mother who is ill, so you are supporting both of them.
- She helped the insurrection but backed out at the same time as you, unable to follow through with the atrocity's she saw others commit.
- She was the last one to see your father alive, it took quite a toll on her losing him      

The first big fight.
