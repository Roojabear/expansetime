**Burn**
 
- **Silver soldiers**
 
Bladed legs and arms, have clockwork movement gears that exposed a small amount works. Non-intelligent, speak with script movement. Very experimental.
 
They are here to slow Sadri's movements, to appease the masks.
 
To break from the contract is to not fulfil the masks quota, this would not be good, the baron is a fighting man ready to sacrifice all.
   

**Men**

- Lightweight iron Armour.
- 20hp.
- 10 damage
- Will be controlling the silver man.
- Weak to lightning.
 
**Silver soldiers**
 
- Heavy silver.
- 15hp
- 16damage
- Can take root a target â€“ relevant save.
- Weak to blunt weapons.
    
Sadri will be grateful but worried about other places, may have spies, the baron should not know about her switching power sources.
 
Go investigate the academy, do not let them know your purpose.
