**Recap – we left the dumb dumbs alone.**
 
But they did move the mages to a safe house in the upper district of Frenin. Stromhill.
 
They also got Mikey captured, broke into the house of the iron baron and got some information regarding a certain facility in the Arcalian Range.
 
**So many choices.**
 
Captain Lafayette has a few options.
 
|   |   |
|---|---|
|1.|need to find out what they can from that facility – need plans for the Calex, need to figure out how to stop the mage counters and anything else useful.|
||Either find a way in from the mountains, can take a terkit transport.|
||or find the secret passage to it in the city, some guard will have to know.|
   

|   |   |
|---|---|
|2.|Need to get you guys out of the city. You still have to organize the summit, with or without the Iron Barons help.|
||Will almost certainly need to go through the range on a train?|
||Or could trek over the range to avoid the conflict, but more dangers could hide in the mountains.|
   

|   |   |
|---|---|
|3.|Need to get the diplomats disguises asap, especially the tree, has very little clue on how to do this, one of the old mage hideouts might have something.|
||Will give Michael a way to disguise as a human, not physically just provides a visage.|
||They will also find on a 10+ a Magical Tube, sends letters.|
 
All this while avoiding detection, if they haven't already your family/friends in the city are under stress, maybe check on them.
      

**ARC**
 
**The main housing for this is done at a facility in the arcadian range called the ARC.**
   

Throughout they will find things left by one individual referred to as delta.
 
This allows for the iron and silver to be wrought together with an adhesive formed from KARAK blood.  
It creates a casing powerful enough to,
 
1. Not break under the immense pressure caused by the Core. (not explained)
 
2. Not melt under the heat from the core reactions (not explained)
 
3. Reduce "Ataratic disruption"
   

They have also discovered that by rerouting the power form the core inwards it creates a localized disruption of the weave. Something that can harm a mage given enough direction. Their own weaponized versions of Atarak disruptions.
   

1432 there was a large train disaster that killed 232 new Immigrants to Frenin, cause was determined to be a mage light changing the friction in the track line causing it to derail.
 
placed in reduction towers in order to limit their interaction with the natural world. They will be used as tools there. New initiative.
 
The reason the mages are hunted and placed in reduction towers is due to their "Ataratic disruption"  
Machines and the weave do not work together on a basic level.
 
Physics is rigid, rules bound by its limitations, predictable.
 
Spells break this predictability, it twists and warps the natural world with almost no regard for its laws and create localized disruptions in the natural world. Ataratic disruptions
       
**Dear, Korrin.**
 
It is most unfortunate to hear of diplomatic breakdown regarding the state of Frenin, we ask that you remain calm and proceed with caution as an extraction is not feasible given our current lack of interstellar travel. Your safety is of the upmost concern
 
Furthermore we have discussed what can be done with the speaker and they are working on a solution to your current dilemma, we will update you when we can.
 
However, seeing as you are currently trapped abroad we strongly suggest you continue your mission and attempt to liaison a treaty with the remaining two states.
 
Wishing you the best,  
Erin Tor
