**Personal stuff**  
You are a Dark elf/Drow around 24 years of age.
 
Your earliest memories consist of lush greenery and you mothers blackened eyes amongst them.  
In these days you first began to hear whispers of others attempting to control you.  
It was only your mother who was able to calm the shouts and screams in your head.  
However the first inquisition came, forcing you to flee with your father, leaving your mother behind.  
From then on you had to cope with the otherworldly presence in your head, struggling to maintain control of your own thoughts.  
Eventually you turned to music to drown out the voices.  
Since them you became a self-trained Bard who has lived a survivalists life in the northern wastes of Olothyr for most of your days upon titan.  
Until your father died recently, leaving you clues as to where your mother might be.
 
**His note read**
 
_Son, I apologize for the deceptions but it was her wish to keep you safe. However as I pass into the wheel I know your connection to the goddess will bind you to her mad fate regardless of my silence, so consider this divulgence a forced gesture of love for fear of another's words corrupting you. She seeks places called Soul wells, wherever and whatever they may be._ _I have suspicion enough to believe one is in Shorati, hidden amongst the leaves of the Ygdrasil, hopefully you will find her there._
 
_Give her my love son, be safe._
 
Since your fathers passing your voices have gotten louder and you had a direct connection with the goddess herself.  
However brief it was she commanded you to seek a god woken of hers who has defied her and seeks to bring ruin to her realm. She wishes for you to find them for her and in exchange will grant you a boon of hers.  
As of now you have been travelling the seas and lands to reach the Ygdrasil in Elysium whilst keeping a look out for this god woken of the raven queen.

**World History Titan**  
**General**

- Titan holds a unique connection to the traditional pantheon of gods, as some Kith are born with the physical and magical attributes of a select god. - These kith are called **God- woken.** - They are often approached with caution due to their overwhelming power and mythical qualities. - Titan also has recently discovered **Biomancy,** a technology/magic system that harnesses and uses souls as its fuel. - This has led to increased tensions globally due to the dangers of this technology.

- The planet as a whole is recovering from a recent Inquisition, and the powers at play are struggling to fill the power void that remains in wake of the tragedy.

- Furthermore, since the 2nd inquisition, Majority of Newborns are being born without a soul, left in their wake are husks of children barely able to breathe by themselves.
   

**Gods**

- **The Raven Queen**

A Goddess of life and death.  
Depicted as a tall and slender woman, with flowing black hair and pale, porcelain skin. She almost always wears a blank porcelain mask adorned with black feathers.  
Supposed to be the youngest of the gods, her interactions with the world of kith have been limited.  
To date only three individuals have been blessed enough to gain her Favour and inherent her will in the form of god woken.

- **Sune**

Goddess of love, beauty, passion and flesh.  
Depicted with ==lustrous, impossibly long red hair, the color of which persisted regardless of any other permutations in her appearance, and which often assumed the appearance of flames. Aside from this, her physical manifestation would change from time to time. Her skin might be golden, mahogony, reddish, or ivory, and her eyes might be sky-blue, forest green, almond-shaped, or of darkest amber or honey.==  
==Many in Scgand follow her ways, less religious and more philosophical in their approach.==

- **Pelor**

Is the god of the Sun, Light, Strength, and Healing. He is known as the Shining One, and the Sun Father  
He is known as the creator of much that is good.  
His holy symbol is a face in a sun.  
Pelor wears a white cloak over an intricate golden plate armor. Where a head would be, instead, there is a burning star. An almost featureless male head burns within the corona.  
Twin Godwoken in his image used to rule timanhy and clashed over the treatment of other godwoken.
 - **Mathra**

Goddess of secrets, knowledge and the One Truth.  
Depicted as an eleven woman behind a silver and black veil that seems to shift underneath.  
Faces and limbs often seem to crawl out and around her skin, as if contained within.
 - **Milil**

God of performance, trickery, creativity and Quests.  
Milil appeared as a young, charismatic 10 feet tall male with shoulder-length golden hair, indistinguishable as either human or elf. He wears classic green pied piper outfit, adorned with golden epitaphs.
 - **Nvraata**

God of the seas, chaos and the Unknown depths.  
Nvraata is depicted as a bulbous lurker fish with a female mermaid contained within its mouth as its tounge.  
The beast is Impassive and slow to anger, secure in the knowledge that there are no mortals and few gods who can threaten their status. Once their ire is aroused, however, it is as unstoppable as a cresting wave.
 - **Gorthan/Sylvanus.** 
The twin gods housed within one form.  
Gorthan represents War, Famine, Strife and strength.  
Sylvanus represents the wilds, nature, decay and survival.  
Depending on the state of the worlds their form will change.  
==Sylvanus was known as the== **Old Father**==. It took the form of an old, bearded== ==human== ==male face, either floating midair among trees or sprouting from the trunk of an especially large and old tree. The flesh of this form was always brown, gray, and fissured like old wood==
 
==Gorthan was known as simply== **War**==. His body was ash with tints of red, bullish and brute like he towered over the other gods. A Minotaur in form his horns were sharp and drip with black ichor.==
 
**Other**
 
You have recently heard whispers in your head of a new god among the major pantheon, one ascended from another world than titan.
 
**Places you would know of.**
 
**Timanhy (inquisition guys)**

- A Religious state that as of current, is in the worst state it has been in since its genesis as a country.
- Worshiping Pelor, those within are often followers of his holy precepts.
- The country is still recovering from losing a war against a united coalition, after Timnahy, under military leadership, perpetrated a holy inquisition against the **God-woken** of other denominations and any country that harbored them.
- This was not the first inquisition, as 15 years prior, they invaded and occupied Shorati for harboring God woken.
- Currently they are under military occupation from Shorati and are seeking to distance themselves from the events of the past.
 
**Olothyr ( where you are from)**

- A land of barren tundra and ice governed through conflict between 26 tribes of varying kith.
- It recently united under a single banner to lay waste to Timanhy, under the pretense of war dictated by the Al Demera.
- Since its crusade across the god of lights lands, many tribes have returned to the north, wealthy and satiated from their rampage in the south.
- However some still roam the countryside, enjoying their new life of banditry in the plains of Timanhy.
   

**Shorati (where you are now)**
 - A land of lush wilds and greenery, recently reclaimed by a guerilla force named the Al Demera during the second inquisition.
- This is where you and your family used to live, under a large tree named the Ygdrasil in a city called Elysium.
- The forest that encompasses much of Shoratis landscape seems to ebb and move in ways you do not understand, sometimes it will impede your path, other times shove you in a direction, its motive is unknown but you are certain it is alive and thinking.
