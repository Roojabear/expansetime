# The core cities 

## Frénin  

- Controlled by the Iron Baron. [[Technocrats]]

- Built before the base of a large mountain pass called the Arcalian range, it is home to the Iron Baron and was the first city to fall to the Industrial Insurrection. 

- Before the insurrection it was held by the archmagi Adrien Courtet a respected mage of the 3rd scribe. 

- A thick smog has begun to build up over the city, where some days production meets its makers overwhelming demands and blocks out the sky. The stars do not exist as you can no longer see them, you will never touch them, instead the smog fills your lungs and kills your dreams. 

- It is the economic capital of the core Cities, where trade and industry meet as the Arcalian range  are stripped bare for any mineral that can help contain the Cores and drive production. 

- Coming and going are transports to cart away novella cores and other technology through the mountain range until they reach the other core cities. 

- Throughout the town are Hacknit carriages bound to tracks that interweave into the carts, the wealthy use these to traverse the city, the sound of metal whines can be heard from miles away alerting all those nearby.  

- The poor are forced to walk or hitch rides upon Terdic transports, Slow moving lorries that cart about dangerous materials from the mountains, to factories, to local centre's, to the pass and back. Production never ceases and the loud groans of their clockwork engines is the ambience to the city. 

## Martippes [[Martippes.png]] 

- The second core city to be taken during the Industrial Insurrection. 

- It is governed by Sadri whispers and her court of Ministers, who focus on technological development and the progression of new inventors. 

- Lies on the far right side of the Arcalian Range, into the plains of Perteco.  

- Uses its flat ground and plains to distribute power throughout the core cities through pylons that now litter the land. 

- Houses the Prestigious Academy of whispers. 

## West-cross 

- The capital of the Core city's, was the last to be taken by the insurrection. However rather than falling to violence, it was diplomatically given in order to save the lives of the high mages. 

- Was the crown jewel of the Aciem regime, home to the library of the first scribe which is now rubble, a monument to the Age of technocrats. 

- This is where the Aciem Regime was formally crushed, as after the surrender of West Cross the high mages and their family's were summarily executed In front of the library of the first [[Scribes]], before being buried beneath the rubble. It is said their cries for help can still be heard beneath their stone tomb. 

- This is where the Technocrats meet to discuss developments and where many ministers live. A very high class city, a testament to the wealth and power that can come with excelling in this world. 

# Cities defiant 
## Karnaka of Serkonos Sands

- Across the Abyss of Eckermore lies the Serkonos sands, a large desert that holds the grand merchant city of karnaka. 

- This city has been an independent state for centuries, both the Aciem regime and technocratic union have failed to persuade the city to join their cause. 

- Ruled by a succession of thief kings, they are placed on the throne for their cunning ways and ability to benefit the city through the freedom of information. 

- Current thief king, Karro Redrock, is attempting to steal novella core designs to limit the power of the Technocratic union and to give open source access to them for his countrymen.

## Bémont

- A port town to the west of Frenin 

- A town, built recently on the foundations of a small fishing village which has now been replaced with an industrial port. The some here still try to live a simple life fishing, they are politely "encouraged" to join the technocratic union. 

- It is the first town to be "built" by the technocrats that seeks to expand their empire across The Abyss of Eckermore, a large sea that divides the lands.
