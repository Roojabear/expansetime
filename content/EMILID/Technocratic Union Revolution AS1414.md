## **Industrial Insurrection** 

- In 1414 the Industrial insurrection occurred after Callus Treadwell, a Satyr of the lower classes, developed the ability to create a “Novella core”. The Novella core is a battery that is able to power technology.
- The technocrats covet him as a martyr as he died during the insurrection. 
- This sparked the lower classes to rise against the upper class, seizing power for themselves. 
- After this revolution, technocrats took charge, forming a new system called the technocratic union focused on the evolution of technology and abolishment of the teachings of the scribes. 
- No more Monarchs only industry and structure.
- With the revolutionaries long gone, the planet has settled into a consumerist society of which “novella cores” power the world.
