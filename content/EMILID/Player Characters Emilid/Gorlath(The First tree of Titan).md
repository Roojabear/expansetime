**Name**:  
**General.**
 
- You are The First Tree of Titan, only the soil knows your true name, your roots still tingle with old sensations that become memory.
- The First Tree is but a title, there are many trees as old but none left like you.
- You are an Ereg Yal "A Great Iron Bark", the last of your kind.
- Being rooted to the soil of titan for ages has exposed you to the weave of the world. Eventually making you a magical Ent, a living tree.
 
- Your grove lies within the land of Shorati, in the forest of the Yggdrasil, outside the city of Elysium, a city you helped form through your negotiations.
- You were at the beginning of Titan.
- A sapling when the earth was bare you felt nothing but your roots touching others, and amongst it, a single beating heart.
- Then you felt the flapping of wings brush your leaves as you grew towards the twin moons.
- Then many small pattering's, critter's, crawlers and creatures took up home in your grove.
- Then they came, taking with them all surrounding till just you remained.
- Then Death.
- Then silence.
- You "awake" for the first time centuries ago.
- What triggered it you do not know but eyes opened and the world was of new sensation.
- Before you was a small elven boy, about 12, praying to you in your grove, his name Solas.
- Scared that he had awoken a beast he ran to gather the others. When he returned with many elves you were able to speak to them.
- Convinced you were of great power they enlisted your aid in order to speak to the Yggdrasill (a large world Tree in the center of the forest), to beg it to allow for a city to be built in its shade.
- It took months to establish a connection and each day Solas would visit and teach you to speak elvish and talk to you about the world, he was your only friend.
- But Eventually You spoke to it, in abstract. It agreed to the establishment of Elysium. It drained you of so much energy you needed to return to your slumber.
- Before sleeping the Elves signed a pact with you in order to protect your grove due to your great deed done for them.
 
**Early History (sensations)**
 
**First waking**
   

**Now**

- You sleep, feeling the same sensations of the world again.
- war has occurred but you could not wake to protect the forest.
- You wait, hoping to wake to experience the world again.
   

**Things you know about recent world history.**
   

**The war**
 
- The leaves speak of a recent inquisition against the forest and the god woken within.
- The ones who worship Pelor from the far land of Timahny enacted this cruelty upon the world.
- Their land is now weak and their leaders struggle to return the faith.
   

**The land above you**
 
- Your roots tell you the land above, Scgand, an ally during the wars refuses any post war alliances.
- They are ruled by a fool and a charlatan that cannot control their country.
 
**The lands away**
 
- The land of khoalo is attempting to create a new form of magic out of the souls of living/dead creatures.
- Their hope is to get rid of the weave and godly presence in order to give more power to the kith.
 
**The world**
 
- New kin and saplings are being born without souls, Any kith are born hollow and zombie like.
- The world is therefore dying due to this lack of a new generation being born.
- People are scrambling to find solutions to this issue
