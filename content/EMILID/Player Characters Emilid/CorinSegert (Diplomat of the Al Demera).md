**Background**  
**Segert Prime**
 
- **Age:** 73
- Male
- Tree Elf
 
**Beginnings**
 
- Segerts first memory is from the age of 15 when he was no longer permitted to take **CADLAH.**
- The memory itself is of his master, **Gun Aithne** (‘Unknown’), waking him for his first day of training as a knower.
- The training took place in **Falaichte** (‘Hidden’) over 10 years. Segert has no clue where this was on Titan but it was cold and mountainous.
 
**Training involved:**
 
**Combat.**

- Sometimes disciples of Marthra act out of line and it’s up to the knowers to deal with them. They also need to be the last line of defense for their sect.
 
**Espionage**.

- For obvious reasons. Knowers are to know and not be known.
 
**Politics:**

- Working powerful people to your advantage is an important skill in monitoring world events.
 
**Culture:**

- Knowing the languages and cultures practiced on Titan is essential in identifying where individuals are deviating from their necessary path.  
**After training:**
 
- At the age of 25 when his training was complete he was given leadership of a sect, **Dhìochuimhnich Mi** (I forgot)
- This is a Small uninhabited island off the northern coast of **Shorati**.
- The sect mostly collects information and the **Shorati** and **Scgand** governments, and performs hits where necessary to keep the continent in line with **Marthra**’s ideals.
- Received a message from his **handler** who is unknown to him but is identifiable by their unique encoding system.
- The message is about the discovery of **Awoenath, the convergence**, and the potential for interplanetary travel.
- The **Al Demera** are the source of this information and the job requires infiltration by Segert himself.
- To ensure everything went smoothly, Segert created a personality which would infiltrate the Al Demera under his guidance but with no knowledge of the Cult of Marthra.
- This is **OLAF**
 
**The first truth.**

- This is the core of Mathra's ideals
- An unknown secret that must be protected at all costs, as your group seeks to uncover where it lies, eliminating those that might stumble upon clues.
- Mathra guides and protects those that would seek out the truth for her.   **Acquaintances**
 
**Handler**

- An enigmatic figure that exists above you within the **Order of Mathra.**
- Has only contacted you a handful of times since you joined your sect.
- Did not approve the "segert split' initially, but did after deliberation.
- The missives are encoded and often seem to be from the goddess herself.
- They always concern **The First Truth.**
 
**Peeps**

- A small gnomish woman who wears a shifting black veil at all times.
- You have left her in charge of **Dhìochuimhnich Mi** in your absence.
- Her demeanor is determined and strong, you think had you not been chosen for your position, she would be above you.
- She advocated for your current mission, after the handler did not approve.
- Is assigned to "pull you out" should the first truth become compromised due to your mission.
  **Olaf ( The Split One)**
 
- **Age:** Technically 3, thinks he's 30
- **Male**
- **Tree Elf**
 
**Beginnings**
 
- Olaf was born and raised in a traveling caravan that traveled around **Scgand**. There wasn’t much to his childhood.
- His Father (John) was medium, and his Mother (Jane) the assistant. Olafs job was always to just collect the fee from the patrons.
- Olaf resented his life and came to resent his parents for it. They never had any money and so they could never break away from the caravan However, his parents loved the life and said its worth any cost to see the world.
- When Olaf was 20 he started his own show within the caravan as a barker to try and buy his own way out but never managed to save much.
- At the age of 27 a ravenous disease took over much of the caravan. Olaf survived but his parents didn’t.
- On that day Olaf left the caravan and swore to earn a comfortable life for himself. He traveled to Elysium where he signed up with the Al Demera as a diplomatic assistant and quickly worked his way up to conducting his own diplomatic missions.
 
**At the Al Demera**
 
- Joined at the end of the Pelaian Inquisition in order to help mend post war political ties.
- Over the past 3 years you quickly worked your way up the ranks from paper pusher, to chief of Scgand negotiations.
- Therefore you have had frequent meetings with the advisors to the throne of Scgand, chiefly an Arakokra Fedror.
- You were most recently tasked with forming an official post war alliance between states, this did not end as intended, with talks breaking down as the Al Demera wish King Piranesi to relinquish political control, they refused.
- On return to Elysium you were told to meet with the higher ups concerning important business.
