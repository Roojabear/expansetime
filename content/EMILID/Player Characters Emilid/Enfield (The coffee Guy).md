Sad
 
**Beginnings**
 - You were born in 1394 in the city of Martippes during the Aciem Regime.
- You grew up poor but not on the streets, your family struggled to survive as your parents had to support both you and your two siblings.
- Working as "the Help" to the ruling class your parents slaved away to keep the family afloat.
- They were supporters of the Industrial insurrection.    
**Your time in the Industrial Insurrection**
 - Once the insurrection had swept through Frenin and established itself as a force they marched upon Martippes.
- Hearing word of the force coming over the Arcalian range fighting broke out within the city.
- You joined the chaos briefly as the city burnt for 34 hours.
- You witnessed family's kill each other in the streets, mages be executed brutally, children killed for having the slightest amount of magical talent.
- Those who could read the scribes texts were blinded in an act of cruelty.
- Finally any monument or testament to the old ways were destroyed within the chaos.'
- Both your brother and your sister were members of the Revolution also, with your brother fighting till the bitter end.
- By the time the main force had reached Martippes, the fighting had finished and you had been recognized as one of the brave few who stood up against the oppressors.
- Your brother was held in high regard for his part in the battle.    
**Now**
 - Now for all your hard work you have been given a place amongst the technocratic union.
- Although simple, your job is important, you are the coffee man.
- Working under the technocrat Sadri Whisper, you help those who supply power to the Core cities.
- Recently you have been tasked with receiving the off-worlders in place of both your boss and therefore the electric queen, Sadri Whisper
- This is occurring due to an attempt made on Sadri's life, she has not been seen outside of her Mansion in Martippes since.      

**History**
 - Emilid, from the time of genesis has existed comfortably without the weave.
- Originally a nomadic, tribal based world, now lost as the scribes came to be.
- The five scribes, writers of such renown and power, developed runic writings and gave the planet magic
- From this aristocratic classes of magic wielders took power in 1216, forming nations under schools of magic/teachings of scribes, only those wealthy and schooled enough could wield this power. This period of time was called the Aciem regime. 
- In 1414 the Industrial insurrection occurred after **Callus Treadwell**, a Satyr of the lower classes, developed the ability to create a “**Novella core**”. (The Novella core is a battery that is able to power technology.)
- The technocrats covet him as a martyr as he died during the insurrection.
- This sparked the lower classes to rise against the upper class, seizing power for themselves.
- After this revolution, technocrats took charge, forming a new system called the technocratic union focused on the evolution of technology and abolishment of the teachings of the scribes.
- With the revolutionaries long gone, the planet has settled into a consumerist society of which “novella cores” power the world.
- Current year is 1435 AS   
- The top 1% help run the "Core cities" as ministers implementing laws and procedures under the guidance of the Barons.
- There is a huge gap in Class, as many struggle to live and die of starvation, working themselves to the bone in factories to earn a pittance.
- Society is run by the three technocrats as they each control a separate section of the **"core cities"**
- Your home city
- The second core city to be taken during the Industrial Insurrection.
- It is governed by Sadri whispers and her court of Ministers, who focus on technological development and the progression of new inventors.
- Lies on the far right side of the Arcalian Range, into the plains of Perteco.
- Uses its flat ground and plains to distribute power throughout the core cities through pylons that now litter the land.
- These pylons have no lines connecting them, they are huge tesla coils that launch lightning bolts to power cores that then distribute throughout the core cities. - Built before the base of a large mountain pass called the **Arcalian** range, it is home to the Iron Baron and was the first city to fall to the Industrial Insurrection.
- A thick smog has begun to build up over the city, where some days production meets its makers overwhelming demands and blocks out the sky.
- It is the economic capital of the core Cities, where trade and industry meet as the **Arcalian** range are stripped bare for any mineral that can help contain the Cores and drive production. 
**Bémont**  

- A port town to the west of Frenin
- A town, built recently on the foundations of a small fishing village which has now been replaced with an industrial port. The some here still try to live a simple life fishing, they are politely "encouraged" to join the technocratic union.
- It is the first town to be "built" by the technocrats that seeks to expand their empire across The Abyss of Eckermore, a large sea that divides the lands.
- A Large technocrat who sustained heavy damage in the **Industrial Insurrection** and has replaced his body with clockwork like machinery.
- Holds the means of production through the mines that are used to source metal that hold the **Novella Cores** together.
- Has most of the factories that produce Cores and any clockwork machinery.
- Runs the **Core city** of **Frenin****.**
 **Magnate Sadri Whisper, Queen of lightning**  

- A small gnomish lady who gained prominence through ruthless brutality that juxtaposes her size.
- Focused on the mass distribution of **Novella Core** energy that comes from her **"Frames"** she powers the core cities and allows lights, transport and other necessities to function.
- Recently an attempt was made on her life, she is on edge and the underworld is going crazy over finding out who tried to kill her.
- She is who you represent.

- He was a heavy believer of the technocrats ideals, going so far as to leading a sect of revolutionists early into the revolts.
- You remember him stealing a coin pouch from a Aciem Nobel and getting beat for it, so that you could afford a stuffed toy to help you sleep.
