**The Devoted**  
**Age:** 20 ish  
Openly vampire, Twink  

- Either way you joined the Court of Ceremonies at about age 10.
- Your initial duties were that of a caterer. One that prepared meals and entertainment for gatherings between the courts. You often listened intently to both the official procedures and high-class rumors from the courts. This attentiveness is what helped you rise through the court.
- It is during one of these meetings that you would have seen _The Sire/ Eldest_ the “vampire” that rules your lands and one of the living gods. They were enshrouded in shadow emitting from their form, but through the darkness you spotted deep amber eyes. You have not seen them since.
- You were about 16 when you first prepared a ritual sacrifice. It went perfectly.

**Adult/now**

- You remain within the court living within the walls of the _Umbral Citadel_

_(Where the court proceedings happen)_ in the heart of _Lavinia (the lands ruled by The Sire)_

- Your day-to-day duties consist of preparing rituals, feasts, court gatherings and grand balls.
- You have recently heard stirrings within the court of treason and questioning of _The Sires_ power due to the convergence being something out of their control. These voices are often silenced very quickly.
- Also 4 Edicts have recently been proclaimed in the hope of changing the land to a more defensive position, as if a prelude to all-out war.
- Due to your dedication to _The Sire,_ you have been selected to spread the word of their graces to the other realms beyond yours. An edict will need to be proclaimed to achieve this.
- This party of delegates consist of 2 delegates from each “god”.

**History of Domain.**   **Planet –** Domain – or The Domain.  

- Domain is currently in its 656th year.
- Its foundation myth surrounds that of the three godlike figures that inhabit the world.
 _It is said they was a singular shooting star that was tired of their trek across the galaxy and in an effort to plant roots they founded the world of Domain to share with subjects._   _However, upon creation something was lost, their singular will split into three with each laying claim to the power lost to the other two._  
_From this conflict kith were born, as no god wished to destroy their new world, they instead had subjects to fight wars for them._  
_Since then, an eternal war has been waged as none can best the other,_  
_None of their magics may harm the other, therefore it is prophesied that a kith must slay the gods._   _The Sire lays claim, as they were the first born of the star. The eldest and truest Overlord that was usurped by the other two in an act of accident during the creation of Domain. They Consider themselves the shooting star that fell and shattered, one that needs to be reforged._   **Since then**

- The world has been a mixture of war and peace.
- As the Gods cannot harm one another, they send armies to war for them.
- They also refuse to obliterate other lands as they fear retaliation will occur.
- Therefore, there is a sort of purgatory that is occurring as they wish to dispose of one another but cannot.
