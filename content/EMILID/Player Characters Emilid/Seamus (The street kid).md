Age: Mid 20s  

- Born sometime in the 1405-1412 to a wealthy family, aristocrats within the Aciem Regime.
- You remember very little other than your mother being a practicing mage and your father doing something in the courts.
- During the industrial insurrection of 1414 your family was killed by the revolutionists in whatever way you want to describe, whether you remember or not is up to you.
- The insurrection lasted 33 hours, a massacre that forced out the aristocrats of the scribe ruled Aciem regime and placed in charge the Technocratic union changing landscape of Frenin forever.
- During that time, you were found Cal Kraven, a gangster from the Strathclyde syndicate, who did not save you due to kindness, but for opportunity, something he reminds you of often.

**Since then**

- You grew up in your teens working for the Strathclyde syndicate as both a way to survive and a way of maintaining the only human connection you have to the world.
- Being the right-hand man of Cal Kraven, you worked your way up the ranks quickly, eventually joining a coup headed by Cals to replace the head of the syndicate with him.
- Since then, things have gone smoothly, under Cals guidance the syndicate has been expanding, gaining the attention of both other crime families and the iron guard.
- You are situated as the gang’s fixer, the right-hand man of the don, one with no job but many duties, anything that _needs_ to be done, gets done and gets done well.
 **Now**  
**The iron Guards proposition**

- Recently things have begun to stir in the city, mages have access to power unprecedented and the guard are more ruthless than ever.
- Recently you were threatened by a high member of the Iron Guard, Dominic Hunt, to lead the guard to the location of the mage underground.
- This ended in a massacre of those involved, but managed to save your skin
- Your gang does not know of this interaction.
- Dominic has requested to see you again regarding another _job_
 **Strathclyde syndicate**

- Your work and family, a middling gang that you have been a part of since the day of the insurrection.
- It focuses on the trade of _Rat Rot_ a liquid illicit substance distilled from the remains of diseased rats, very little is known about the process of how it is made.
- This trade is usually to miners as it seems to cure their _silver cough_ a consequence of working in the mines.
- It also has the added effect of producing hallucinogenic experiences and euphoria.
- Its leader is Cal Kraven
         
**Allies and acquaintances**   **Cal Kraven.**

- Head of the syndicate, he is your boss and surrogate dad to a degree, though you have never called him such.
- A Large, well-maintained man for being in his late 50s, he dresses only in well worn blue suits. He is bald with a beard covering most of his face and his eyes are deeply socketed into his face. The rest of his body is tattooed with writing and art, seemingly in defiance of the Iron Guard.
- He Cares for you, distantly, mostly as an asset but beneath it all is respect and pride in you

**Trent “trunk” kraven.**

- A large hunk of flesh is what epitomizes Cals son.
- He is an ugly balding mass of mainly fat but some muscle, that uses his leverage in the gang to bang women and solicit bribes for his terrible Rat Rot addiction.
- He is dumb, cocky and arrogant, unable to keep his mouth shut even if the world depended on it.
- He has always been jealous of your relationship with his father.

**Sly**

- You know little about sly other than his tendency to speak in rhyme and rhythm.
- He is a funny halfling that often accompanies you when the _job_ requires an extra pair of small hands.
- He respects you and even considers you a friend, vouching for your position as a the one to succeed Cal.
 **Astrid Batteux (BATT-O)**  

- Your local bartender at the Hounds Pit Pub, just around the corner from your house.
- A burly woman in her late 20s, tattoos up both arms and short black hair, with a hat on she looks like a male miner.
- You are mildly friends, but she knows little about you, only not to ask what you do for a living.
   
**Dominic Hunt**  

- The iron guard who forced you to rat.
- He is hard to gauge behind the iron armor he wears but is clearly a force of pure physicality, you have never seen his face, and he likes that
- He is vile and repugnant, smelling of vinegar constantly.
- You know he will use you until you break, be careful.
