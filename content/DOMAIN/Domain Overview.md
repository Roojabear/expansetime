# Foundations
Domain is currently in its 656th year.**

## Myth of Creation

_It is said they was a singular shooting star that was tired of their trek across the galaxy and in an effort to plant roots they founded the world of Domain to share with subjects._  
_However, upon creation something was lost, their singular will split into three with each laying claim to the power lost to the other two._  
_From this conflict kith were born, as no god wished to destroy their new world, they instead had subjects to fight wars for them._  
_Since then, an eternal war has been waged as none can best the other,_  
_None of their magics may harm the other, therefore it is prophesied that a kith must slay the gods._  

**Sire**

They Consider themselves the shooting star that fell and shattered, one that needs to be reformed in their own image.

## **Overview**

- The world has been a mixture of war and peace.
- As the Gods cannot harm one another, they send armies to war for them.
- They also refuse to obliterate other lands as they fear retaliation will occur.
- Therefore, there is a sort of purgatory that is occurring as they wish to dispose of one another but cannot.


**Edicts**

- This is how the Overlords exert their will.
- Rather than casting their magic themselves they send people in their stead to proclaim their grand magikas.
- This often kills the individual.
- Those that survive are considered people of grand renown.
- No one has cast an edict twice.
