The Team Sheet serves as the heart of Camaraderie, encapsulating the feeling of belonging to an adventuring party. It's more than just a list; it embodies the complexities of camaraderie, from love and admiration to jealousy and even hatred, forming the core of your experince with the game.  
The Team sheet consists of potent actions, built from both individual skill trees and the Partys tree accessible at any moment by expending inspiration. These actions possess the power to dynamically alter the battlefield in your favor, tipping the scales of fate when needed most.
 
How do you Gain Inspiration? While it has been mentioned previously in certain sections, we will recap all the ways you can gain inspiration whilst playing.
 
**Rituals**  
In character representations of  
**Rites:**  
Successfully completing a Rite offers the weaver a chance to bestow inspiration upon your party.  
**Milestones:**  
Milestones mark significant events that tie up plot threads or conclude adventures. Examples include thwarting Dwarven assassins plaguing the countryside or rescuing a cat from a tree. They serve as opportunities to earn experience points for personal character growth and allow the Weaver to grant inspiration to the party. Milestones also provide party experience for use on the Team sheet.  
**Great Roleplay:**  
Comradery hinges on interpersonal connections. Should two players engage in a heartfelt conversation by the fire or debate fiercely about their alignments, the Weaver may reward inspiration for their immersive engagement in the story.  
**Critical successes and critical failures.**
   

Ok so you have been inspired.
