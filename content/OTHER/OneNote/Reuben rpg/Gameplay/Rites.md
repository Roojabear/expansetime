**In the context of gameplay, there are instances where the regular dice rolling system may not suffice. These pivotal moments in your story, occurring over a significant period or carrying immense importance, are known as Rites. Unlike standard rolls, Rites only involve success and failure outcomes.**
 
==For instance, let's imagine your party's objective is to disable a dangerous arcane device that poses a threat to a local village. During combat, while your companions fend off waves of nefarious cultists, your mage, Gorlath, focuses on shutting down the device. This crucial act becomes the turning point of the battle, with the fate of everyone hanging in the balance of Gorlath's success.==  
==It would be unfortunate if Gorlath were to roll a single die and achieve a total of 3 (2+1), leading to the fizzling out of the entire fight. Such an outcome not only diminishes the tension of the moment but also fails to accurately portray Gorlath's skills. In such situations, the Weaver, who oversees the game, may opt for multiple dice rolls to determine the event's outcome, setting a threshold Gorlath needs to reach within a specific number of rolls.==  
==For example, the Weaver might secretly establish a threshold of 20 over the course of three rolls. Gorlath then proceeds to roll three times, adding the results together. Let's say Gorlath rolls a 7, 6, and 12, yielding a total of 21. In this case, Gorlath succeeds. The Weaver describes the unfolding events to the players without revealing the result until the final moment: "As you begin to shut down the machine, crackling energy emits venomous bolts in all directions. The beast is far from tamed! However, your determination surges, and you can feel the power surging through your fingertips. You push back against the machine and finally manage to shut it down. The threat is no more."==
 
==Note that these rolls can occur at the same time, or over the course of a few combat turns. Feel free to drag them out, adding tension to a fight, forcefully removing a party member from the fight as they need to focus on another task. This also allows for characters who might want to shy away from direct combat still have tasks to achieve. Picking locks of prisoners, convincing a local crowd to join the fight, dispelling magic on an artifact.==  
==This approach intensifies the moment and allows Gorlath's attributes and skills to contribute significantly. With the broader threshold, additional modifiers can come into play. Perhaps Gorlath's friends are nearby, inspiring him, granting a +1 bonus to the next roll. Or maybe Gorlath's previous injury's distract him, giving a â€“2 to all rolls. Rites are designed to reflect moments of immense tension and significance, enabling modifiers based on personal connections and enhancing the roleplaying aspect of these events.==
 
**However these rites also allow failure to occur.**  
==For instance, let's imagine your party faces a daunting challenge where they need to decipher a complex ancient script to unlock the secrets of a hidden chamber. The Weaver decides to introduce a Rite to heighten the tension and significance of this moment.==  
==The party's scholar, Elara, steps forward to attempt the daunting task. The Weaver secretly sets a threshold of 18 over the course of two rolls. Elara begins her attempts, rolling a 9 on her first roll. The Weaver describes the scene, "Elara meticulously examines the intricate glyphs, pouring over each symbol with great concentration, but she struggles to piece together their meaning."==  
==Elara takes a deep breath, hoping for a better outcome on her second roll. However, luck is not on her side as she rolls a disappointing 5. The Weaver continues, "Despite her continued efforts, Elara finds herself increasingly frustrated. The ancient script remains an enigma, eluding her grasp."==  
==In this instance, Elara fails to meet the threshold, and the Weaver describes the consequences of her inability to decipher the script. Perhaps a trap is triggered, causing the chamber to start collapsing, or an ancient guardian awakens, initiating a challenging battle for the party. The failure adds an element of suspense and presents the adventurers with a new obstacle to overcome.==  
==Remember, failures within Rites can lead to intriguing plot developments, unexpected twists, or heightened stakes, providing opportunities for the players to adapt their strategies, delve deeper into the narrative, and face new challenges head-on.==
 
==Importantly, Rites also contribute to the development of your Comradeire sheet, marking another milestone on your journey towards becoming a fully-fledged adventuring party.==
