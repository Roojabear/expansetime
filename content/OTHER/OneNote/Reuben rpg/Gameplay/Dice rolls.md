**2d6 (1d6)**  
Camaraderie uses a 3d6 dice system (or what I will call a 2d6 + (1d6) system) meaning very simply that you will need three six sided dice. Two for general rolls and one for special rolls. We recommend having two very similar dice and one fun, bombastic, SPECIAL dice.Â 
 
During both general roleplay and combat players will use two six-sided dice, commonly referred to as 2d6, to generate results between 2 and 12. Pretty simple right?
 
We can then divide the type of normal rolls you will need to make during gameplay into 3 types of checks.
   

Skill checks.  
Combat rolls. (Gaining AP)  
Attribute saves.
   

**Skill checks.**  
==Skill checks occur when a player wants to perform an action outside of combat. These actions typically involve interacting with the environment, gathering information, or attempting tasks that require specialized knowledge or expertise. To initiate a skill check, the player would state what they want to interact with or describe the action they wish to perform, which lies outside of general movement or basic actions.==  
==For example, let's say the party's scholar wants to try to understand the historical significance of the ancient dwarven ruins they intend to delve into. The scholar expresses their desire to gather information and gain insights into the history of the ruins, hoping to uncover any valuable knowledge or clues.==  
==In response, the game weaver, who serves as the storyteller and adjudicator of the game's rules, would ask the scholar to make a history check. The history check is a skill check associated with the scholar's proficiency in historical research and understanding. The weaver would set a target number, known as the skill total (ST), in their head for the scholar to reach or exceed.==  
==The ST represents the difficulty and significance of the skill check. In this case, the weaver might determine that the dwarven ruins are centuries old and have limited documentation available. As a result, understanding anything substantial about the ruins requires a significant effort. The weaver sets the ST to 12, meaning the scholar needs to roll a skill total of 12 or higher to succeed in gaining meaningful insights into the ruins' historical significance.==  
==The player will then roll the 2d6 dice and add their history number from their areas of expertise.==  
**Let's say they roll an 10 on the dice (4+6)** **and add their history skill (+2)**  
**Intellect +2**

- ==Physics: [+2 ]==
- ==Medicine: [+2 ]==
- ==Engineering: [+2 ]==
- **History: [ +2]**
- ==Investigation: +2]==
- ==Linguistics: [ +2]==
 
==Their total outcome is a 12!==  
==The player then relays this total to the weaver, who takes into account the target number (ST) set for the skill check. In this case, the ST was 12. Since the player's total outcome of 12 matches the ST, the player succeeds in their attempt to understand the historical significance of the ruins.==  
==The weaver, as the storyteller, will now narrate and describe the events according to the level of success achieved. The player's success in the skill check means they gain meaningful insights into the dwarven ruins' historical importance. The weaver can provide relevant information, such as the ruins being old storehouses for ancient dwarven kings. The weaver may describe details about the ruins' architectural style, their purpose, and their connection to the dwarven civilization of that era.==  
==It's important to note that skill checks in the game are not always binary, with a simple pass or fail outcome. Sometimes, skill checks can have varying degrees of success based on multiple target numbers (ST) set by the weaver.==  
==For example, the weaver may introduce two levels of success for this skill check, with different STs. They could set an easier ST of 6, where the scholar gains basic information about the ruins' age and function as storehouses for ancient dwarven kings. This information is relatively straightforward and readily available.==  
==Additionally, the weaver may set a more challenging ST of 13. If the player had reached or exceeded this ST, the scholar would have discovered a hidden scroll while investigating the ruins' history. This scroll reveals that the ruins later became the headquarters of a secretive cult known as the Black Sun Dragon after they fell into disuse and were lost to time. This information represents a more abstract and intriguing aspect of the ruins' history, unveiling a hidden layer of mystery.==  
==By incorporating multiple STs, the weaver can offer players different levels of information and rewards based on their level of success in the skill check. This adds depth, complexity, and a sense of discovery to the game, allowing players to unravel the secrets of the game world gradually.==
   

**Combat rolls**  
==In combat, the mechanics differ from skill checks. Instead of using areas of expertise and setting target numbers (ST) for success, combat relies on predetermined marks of success or failure. Additionally, combat utilizes base attributes rather than areas of expertise.==  
==In combat scenarios, you will roll 2d6 and add your martial attribute or casting attribute, depending on the type of action you are taking.==  
==For martial actions, such as physical attacks or combat maneuvers, you would add your martial attribute to the result of the 2d6 dice roll. This attribute will be your higher attribute between Vigor and Dexterity.==  
==On the other hand, for casting actions, such as casting spells or using magical abilities, you would add your casting attribute to the result of the 2d6 dice roll. This attribute will be your chosen casting attribute (or if you have multiple, the higher attribute).==  
==If you intend to both use martial skills and magic in a single combat action, you may roll your higher of the two stats, be that Martial or Casting.==  
==By using these base attributes in combat, the focus shifts away from specific areas of expertise and emphasizes your character's overall combat prowess or magical aptitude. This also speeds up combat as dice rolls will quickly give you an outcome with simple math, rather than a back and forth with the weaver setting ST.==  
==The outcome of the combat action will be determined based on the total result of the dice roll and attribute modifier.==  
**Here's a breakdown of the possible results:**
 
2 on the dice: Critical Failure - The action goes disastrously wrong, often with severe consequences. Critical failures may lead to unintended side effects, harm to the character, or significant setbacks in the story. You will gain No Ap for this roll. The weaver will gain 4 fate points in response to this disastrous outcome. This only occurs when the die show snake eyes and does not consider your attribute points.
 
3-6: Failure - The character's attempt falls short, resulting in a failed action. The character may not achieve their desired outcome or may encounter unexpected obstacles. You will gain 1 Ap from this roll, allowing you to assist your allies through a minor action.  
The weaver will gain 3 Fate points for your failure.
 
7-9: Partial Success - The character succeeds but with complications or limitations. They achieve their goal to some extent, but there may be unforeseen consequences or additional challenges that arise.  
You will gain 3 ap from this. The weaver will gain 2 fate points in response to this roll.
 
10-12+: Success - The character successfully accomplishes their objective without significant issues. They achieve their desired outcome effectively and efficiently. You will gain 6 Ap from this. The weaver will only gain 1 fate point for this roll.   12 on the dice: Critical Success - The action is a resounding success, surpassing expectations. Consider them extraordinary results beyond the character's initial goal. You will gain 7 Ap from this roll and gain an inspiration point. The Weaver will gain 0 fate points for this roll. This only occurs when the die show double six and does not consider your attribute points.
   

**Actions points and Fate points**  
==The outcome of this roll will reward you with Action points (AP) and the Weaver with Fate points (FP). With these AP and FP, the player and weaver respectively will choose actions that use these points.==  
**Action points**  
==Action points (Ap) are a resource that can be used by the player to initiate moves. Moves will look like this on your character sheet.==  
**Moves**  
00 **Impact**: Deal 3 harm to 1 target(s) within melee range.  
00 **Clash**: Mitigate one instance of harm from (1) target(s) in melee range.  
0 **Nows it's your turn**: Give +2 harm to ally who is engaged with the same target as you.
 
These are the basic moves of the Martial strike tree. Let's say we are playing a fighter with +2 Vigor. We would roll 2d6 and add our martial attribute, so +2.  
Let's go through all the outcomes to get an idea of how combat would work.
 
**3-6: Failure**  
You will gain 1 Ap from this roll, allowing you to assist your allies through a minor action.  
Our poor fighter here would only be able to use their help action.  
0 **Nows it's your turn**: Give +2 harm to an ally who is engaged with the same target as you.
 
**7-9: Partial Success**  
You will gain 3 ap from this roll and be able to enact some of your moves. So our fighter may choose to attack and help an ally.  
00 **Impact**: Deal 3 harm to 1 target(s) within melee range.  
0 **Nows it's your turn**: Give +2 harm to ally who is engaged with the same target as you.
   

**10-12+****:** **Success**  
You will gain 6 Ap from this roll and be able to use many moves in this combat exchange.
 
00 **Impact**: Deal 3 harm to 1 target(s) within melee range.  
00 **Clash**: Mitigate one instance of harm from (1) target(s) in melee range.  
0 **Nows it's your turn**: Give +2 harm to ally who is engaged with the same target as you.  
0 **Nows it's your turn**: Give +2 harm to ally who is engaged with the same target as you.
 
Here we are able to block damage from the target we are engaged with, attack them, and help our two allies who are engaged with them.
 
**12 on the dice:** **Critical Success**  
You will gain 7 Ap from this roll and gain an inspiration point. Our fighter might go all out and attack twice this turn  
00 **Impact**: Deal 3 harm to 1 target(s) within melee range.  
00 **Impact**: Deal 3 harm to 1 target(s) within melee range.  
00 **Clash**: Mitigate one instance of harm from (1) target(s) in melee range.  
0 **Nows it's your turn**: Give +2 harm to ally who is engaged with the same target as you.  
Here our player blocks, attacks twice and helps an ally.
 
**Fate points**  
==Fate points represent the Weaver's ability to influence the game world, introduce challenges, or affect the outcome of certain events. The Weaver can spend their FP to create obstacles for the players, enhance the abilities of adversaries, alter the environment, or introduce unexpected twists and turns into the story. FP allows the Weaver to shape the narrative and provide an engaging and dynamic game experience for the players.==
 
==These will be explained in more detail in the weavers section of the handbook.==
    
**Special dice**
 
==In addition to the regular 2d6 rolls for skill checks and combat, the game system introduces a SPECIAL dice (often represented by a 1d6) for various purposes and additional gameplay opportunities. The SPECIAL dice is used to determine outcomes related to specific skills, hazards, and luck checks. Here are some examples:==
 
**Control Rolls:**  
==Mages, for instance, make control rolls using a 1d6 to determine if they lose control of their magical abilities. This roll adds an element of risk and unpredictability to spellcasting, representing the potential for magical mishaps or unintended consequences.==
 
**Complications:**  
==Ranged weapons experts, on the other hand, use a 1d6 roll to determine if their actions draw unwanted attention or if they encounter issues such as the need to reload or maintain their weapon. These complications add a layer of realism and tactical decision-making to ranged combat situations.==
 
**Dismemberment/Shatters:**  
==Some melee classes have the opportunit====y to perform dismemberment or shattering attacks, which involve making an additional 1d6 roll on top of their regular attacks. When activated, these rolls allow them to sever limbs from opponents or break their weapons, providing unique combat options and potentially changing the course of the battle.==
 
==The exact mechanics and details of these SPECIAL rolls can be found in the relevant skill trees or specific rules associated with each skill or ability. It's important to note that usually only one negative SPECIAL roll needs to be made to retain the viability of many skill combinations. For example, a spell-slinging gunslinger may not have to deal with both control and complications, but a sword-fighting mage should still maintain control over their magic. This allows players to focus on the unique aspects of their character's skills and abilities, without feeling too hindered from the mounting complications of their kits.==
 
**Luck checks**  
==Additionally, the SPECIAL dice can be used for luck checks. These checks involve a simple 1d6 roll to determine if the character finds themselves in a stroke of luck or misfortune. For example, the player might ask if they packed a lantern or if there's a hairclip in a dark dungeon to pick a lock. Typically, a 50/50 split is used, where 1-3 represents an unlucky outcome and 4-6 represents a lucky one. However, Weavers have the flexibility to adjust this luck roll in either direction, depending on the circumstances and the player's choices.==
   

**Attribute saves.**
 
**Attribute Saves**  
Attribute Saves occur when the Weaver makes a move against your character. They can occur both inside and outside of combat and are pivotal moments for players. These rolls, akin to combat checks, follow a scale: 6 (failure), 7-9 (partial success), and 10+ (success), each carrying consequences in line with the outcome.  
For instance, imagine the party's wizard accidentally triggers chaos, causing a wall to collapse on them. Everyone affected would need to make a Brawn save.  
Roll: 2d6 + Brawn  
Outcome thresholds lead to varying results:

- **6:** Complete failure. The falling bricks deal 10 harm and leave you prone.
- **7-9:** Partial success. You take 5 damage but manage to avoid most of the rubble.
- **10+:** Success. You burst through the wall unharmed.
- **12+:** Critical success. You smash through heroically, saving another from harm.

These saves may adapt to different attributes if the situation demands it. For instance, the ranger, far away, might use Dexterity to dodge. However, attempting to use Moxy to reason with the wall might not be suitable.   In a similar vein these checks may be used outside of combat when the time calls. For example if someone was to interact with potentially dangerous magic, opening themselves up to corruption from another entity, they may need to make an intellect save.
 
Either way these rolls should be quick and clean, allowing the weaver to give multiple players the chance to respond without too much rolling and response to occur.
 
**Note:** that attacking twice in a turn means your second attack will also trigger a second engagement attack from the target hit. Meaning you will take more damage.
