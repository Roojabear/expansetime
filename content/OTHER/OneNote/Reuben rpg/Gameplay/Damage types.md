Blunt  
Slashing  
Water  
Fire  
Earth  
Lightning  
Nature  
Life  
Death  
Mental
 
**Unarmed**  
Fists and slaps. No inherent bonuses but will gain things in skill trees.
 
**Slashing**  
These are weapons that have blade or edge. A sword, dirk or arrow would suffice. A scythe, great sword or Bolt is better. They deal extra harm to enemy's without deflection, cutting through flesh and bone.
 
1-2-3-4-5 extra harm to enemies without deflection.
 
In context they should be better at cutting rope, ripping sheet and slicing through jungle.
 
**Blunt**  
These are martial weapons that are rounded, blunt, used for breaking and bashing. Armour is rendered rather useless against a good hammer. Maul, mace and fist are things that fit this category.
 
Blunt – 1 -2-3-4-5 extra harm to targets with Armour/Deflection based on deflection.
 
In context they should be better at bashing down walls, doors and other structures.
 
**Elemental/ magic types**  
All will simply change to that elements types.  
Any special abilities will connect to the weapons move set.
 
**Weapons**  
**Slashing and blunt are based on weapon level. (In Magical items)**
 
Common - legendary.
 
**Weapons can then have elemental types in 3 ways.**
 
|   |   |
|---|---|
|Inherently|– will then level with the weapon as it progresses.|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Be enchanted|will be placed upon the weapon by a friend at camp|will start at their enchanter level and need to be tended to by the enchanter to level up.|

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Be infused|– in the heat of the battle you or others may change your damage type.|Will not level at all – only gain damage type.|
 
Do weapons gain both slashing/blunt and elements?. I think so. Buff to martials and also makes sense right? Adds depth?  
Or maybe it’s a nerf cause it gets blocked by both deflection and barrier.
    
**EVOKE IS WEIRD FOR DAMAGE TYPES**
 
It should demonstrate power in terms of size.
 
Evoke feels like avatar – want to be throwing sozin comet shit at the end.
 
Do i want evoke to level within itself???  
Or are skills enough.
