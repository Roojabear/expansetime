**Camp Time**
 
==Camp serves as a vital respite during an adventuring party's arduous journey. It's a sanctuary where you can ready yourself for the challenges ahead, cultivate camaraderie, and mend the wounds incurred in prior skirmishes.==
 
==Depending on the time spent resting, (and where) you may take a certain amount of actions during your camp.==
 
- ==Short rest 4-8 hours: 1 Action point.==
- ==Long rest 8+ hours: 2 Action points.==
- ==Long rest at a Stronghold: 3 Action points per day (Strongholds are explained further below)==
 
==When your party decides to camp for the night, each member can choose to engage in one of the following activities at the cost of an action point: Rest, Watch, Forage or Use a character ability.==
 
**Rest:**  
==Resting allows characters to regain health and recover from . Each character who chooses to rest consumes a ration and rolls a Vigor check. The total roll determines the amount of health restored and fatigue recovered. The higher the roll, the more effective the rest. Resting also replenishes some once per day ability's.==
 
**Watch:**  
==Choosing to keep watch ensures the party's safety during the night. Characters who take a watch roll a Perception check. A successful roll grants a bonus to the party's Perception checks if any danger or unexpected events occur during the night.==
 
**Forage:**  
==Characters who opt to forage search for food and resources to sustain the party. They roll a Survival check to determine their success. A successful roll provides enough food and resources for the party's needs, while a failed roll may result in a limited supply.==
 
**Character camp abilities:**  
==Characters will gain camp abilities during character creation and thought their journey that will allow them to help in their own unique way at camp. These abilities can either be from the pre-determined list of professions below, or be built by the player and Weaver during the character creation process. These abilities should be quick and easy to maneuver,==
 
**Note:** ==These camp abilities should be used as a way to both enhance the effectiveness of your team and add flair to your character that isn't usually represented in other tabletop RPGS. Say your character is the war hardened veteran names Seamus, seen with a large axe in hand he commands the battlefield brutally, but in his downtime at camp he is able to cook wonderful meals and sew clothes back together. Not only are these abilities useful but they flesh out the character and allow for other aspects to rise. Not only is Seamus a powerful combatant leading the way, he is tender and caring when it comes to cuisine for his allies.==
 
**The Chef**  
_A Love of food and all its joys, share it with your fellow adventures._
 
==1 Action â€“ Prepare a meal that strengthens the resolve5 of your allies.==
 
==6: You are unable to prepare the meal properly, lose a ration.==  
==7-9+: You prepare a hearty meal for your allies, Roleplay what your meal looks, tastes and smells like and choose a number of allies to give x+2 harm forward, For each ally chosen consume a ration, they may rest==
 
**The Smith**  
_Cold steel and hardened leather can be the difference between a warm body and a cruel fate._
 
**The Alchemist**  
_Tinctures and poultice for those willing to brave its horrid taste._
 
**The Medic**  
_Give reprieve to your allies that suffer from cut and burn, magical or otherwise they all mend the same._
 
**The Survivalist**  
_Tracking, hunting, camouflage, these are the tools of your trade._
 
**The Enchanter**  
_A blade that spits fire?? Must be the work of an enchanter._
   

==Encounters: While camping, there is a chance of encountering various events or creatures. The Weaver determines the frequency and nature of these encounters based on the story and the surrounding environment. Characters on watch have a better chance of detecting and reacting to potential threats.==
   

==Conditions: Camping in harsh conditions or dangerous environments may impose penalties or additional challenges. Extreme weather, hostile territories, or cursed lands can affect resting, rations, watching, foraging or character abilities.==
 
**Note:** ==The default rules of Comraderie state that you need one ration per member of party to be able to rest. A fairly simple and standard way of forcing you players to prepare for adventures and punishing them for being caught off guard. This can be modified in multiple ways based on the campaign. For example: If you are playing a wilderness survival type campaign, then you might want to modify the rules surrounding camping. Some examples below.==

- ==For one you might require them to have a ration to perform any action at camp, rather than just resting.==
- ==You might set a certain amount of time till rations expire and become inedible.==
- ==You could increase rations for larger characters whilst reducing them for others.==
 
==It is important to remember when adding such rules that Comraderie is intended to be a fun and bonding experience. It's great to add challenge and complexity, as long as it is service to your characters and the story being told. Your "fights" over who should've packed the food, or the fact your goliath ate 10x the rations of the halfling should be in character disputes that change the dynamic of your adventuring party, not real life quarrels that mean your sessions fade into nothingness.==
 
==Suffice to say if any of these rules feel like they are impeding your groups ability to make progress you should consider letting things go.==
 
==Remember, the camping mechanics can be adapted and expanded upon based on the specific needs and themes of your Camaraderie campaign. The Weaver has the flexibility to adjust the difficulty, outcomes, and additional elements to create engaging and immersive camping experiences for the party.==
  
_The most dire of circumstances come not from battle with fiend or man, but the cold of winter when the beasts have retreated to their hidden shelters. Your death will not be swift from blade or incantation, glorious in blood and sweat. No it will be but a slow withering of all that you were, a fading into nothingness, a lack of supply should be your most pressing of concern ._
