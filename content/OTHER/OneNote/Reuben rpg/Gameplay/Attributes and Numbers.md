Attributes, also known as ability scores or stats, represent different aspects of a character's abilities and characteristics. Camaraderie like many other TTRPGS use attributes as a way of building and representing the character you want to play, flaws and all. There are five primary Attributes a player will use along their journey:
    
**Vigor (Vig)**  
Vigor represents physical endurance, resilience, and overall health. It measures a character's physical vitality and their ability to withstand physical strain and hardships. It also gives them an understanding of physiology, how their own body moves, how others moves.
 
**Gameplay effects:**  
A high vigor score enhances a character's stamina, granting 5 increased stamina per point in this attribute.  
It is also used in measuring feats of strength or physical resistance. E.g. kicking down a door or withstanding a paralysis poison.
 
**Dexterity (Dex)**  
Dexterity represents agility, reflexes, coordination, and fine motor skills. It measures a character's nimbleness, speed, and physical finesse.
 
**Gameplay effects:**  
Dexterity enhances a players passive mitigation when taking damage by 1 for each point placed in this ability.  
It may also affect skills related to precision, stealth, and acrobatics. E.g. Running across rooftops or quickly swiping an object.
 
**Intellect (Int)**  
Intellect represents intelligence, knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and mental acuity. It measures a character's mental capacity, memory, and cognitive capabilities.
 
**Gameplay effects:**  
A high intellect score gives the character intellect points in which they may spend in a field to give them bonus's to domain specific rolls. It is also a casting stat, so it may be used in order to channel arcane magik. Choosing Intellect as your casting stat will allow you to gain extra AP at the cost of losing control.
 
**Attunement (Att)**  
Attunement represents connection to the world and its natural phenomenon. It also gives them insight into spiritual awareness, or their sensitivity to magic or the supernatural.
 
**Gameplay effects:**  
A high attunement score gives the player attunement points in which they may spend in a field to give them bonus's to domain specific rolls.
 
**Persona (Per)**  
Persona represents ones presence, charisma, force of personality, and ability to influence others. It measures their social skills, persuasiveness, and leadership qualities. It also represents a characters personal will, their ability to be who they know they are and survive through all their journey will throw at them.
 
**Gameplay effects:** A high persona score enhances a character's ability to charm, persuade, lead, or intimidate others. It may provide bonuses to social interactions, negotiation, and influence over non-player characters. It may also affect a character's ability to gather information, gain allies, or rally companions in critical situations.
 
**NOTE FROM ME:** Unlike other TTRPGS this doesn't necessarily represent your swagger or ability to be the suave bandit you want to be. This is as much the sexy con man as it is the disarming, shy halfling.  
Both are able to get away with things they shouldnâ€™t through their force of personality, albeit in different ways. So if you want to play the slick talker who threatens guards with their dark and brooding demeanor go ahead, but feel free to mix it up and play the book smart ranger whose sheer ability to confuse others with jargon gets them away from trouble.
   

**Stat Blocks:**  
==To bring your character to life in Camaraderie, you will need to choose a stat distribution. This distribution determines the initial values of your character's attributes and plays a significant role in shaping their capabilities and strengths.== ==Consider how different attribute values can enhance or align with your desired character archetype.==  
==The Recommended stat block is:== ==+2,== ==+1,== ==0,== ==0,== ==-1.==  
==Giving a primary attribute, secondary attribute and weak attribute.==  
==This stat block reflects the character's strengths, weaknesses, and areas of expertise. Here's a breakdown of how these attributes can be interpreted for an old soldier character:==  
**VIG (Vigor): +2**  
==Being an old soldier, the character has developed significant physical strength and resilience. They excel in activities that require physical endurance, such as marching long distances, carrying heavy equipment, and engaging in combat. Their high Vigor grants them bonuses in skills like Athletics and enables them to withstand physical challenges.==  
**DEX (Dexterity): 0**  
==The character's Dexterity is average, neither exceptional nor lacking. They possess a reasonable level of coordination and agility, allowing them to perform tasks that require manual dexterity and precision. While they may not be the most nimble or acrobatic, they can still handle themselves adequately in combat and perform tasks that require moderate agility.==  
**INT (Intellect): +1**  
==Having an Intellect of +1 suggests that the character possesses above-average mental abilities and cognitive skills. As an old soldier, they have acquired knowledge and experience through their years of service. They may have expertise in areas like military strategy, tactics, and historical context. Their increased Intellect enhances their abilities in skills such as Medicine, Engineering, Investigation, and History.==  
**ATT (Attunement): -1**  
==With a value of -1 in Attunement, this character may struggle to sense or understand subtle magical or supernatural aspects. They have a limited sensitivity to such phenomena and may find it challenging to attune themselves to the natural world.==  
**PER (Persona): 0**  
==The character's Persona attribute is also neutral. This attribute represents their interpersonal and social skills. As an old soldier, their Persona may have been shaped by their experiences in military life, making them disciplined and able to maintain composure in stressful situations. While they may not possess exceptional charisma or persuasion abilities, they can still interact reasonably well with others.==  
==This stat block reflects the strengths and areas of expertise of an old soldier character, with a focus on physical prowess, intellectual acumen, and a balanced approach to social interactions==  
**Customizing Attributes:**  
==While the recommended stat block provides a balanced starting point for most characters, Camaraderie offers flexibility for attribute customization. You have the freedom to deviate from the suggested distribution to better align with your character concept or playstyle.==  
==Consider altering the stat block by redistributing the points according to your character's strengths and weaknesses. For instance, if you envision a brawny warrior, you might prioritize Vigor and increase its score at the expense of another attribute. Alternatively, if you want to create a nimble rogue, you could allocate additional points to Dexterity for heightened agility and reflexes.==  
==By tailoring your attribute distribution, you can bring your character to life and emphasize their unique abilities and personality traits. Remember, Camaraderie encourages diverse and varied characters, so don't be afraid to experiment and think outside the recommended stat blo====ck.==
 
==With your stat block established, it's time to start building our Areas of expertise.==
