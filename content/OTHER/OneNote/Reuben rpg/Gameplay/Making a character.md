**Now this is the important part**
 
Making your character can both be exciting and daunting. This is an entity that you will be playing as for either the next 3 hours, or the next 3 years. They will have hopes and ambitions, love and loss, victory and death. They are the mantel piece of this story. So it's important we get it right.
 
Now as much as I would love to give you a perfect step by step guide into making a character, I cannot. Some like to build their character around combat mechanics and how fun they are in a fight, some prefer heavy role play and will hinder themselves significantly in order to achieve a vision. Therefore rather than jamming a guide down your throat I will share my recommended process and how I like to make characters but it will not always work for you.
 
Now note this is meant to be the lengthy part of setting up a game. It may take an hour or two to really get down what you want so take time, take breaks, have snacks and get it right.
   

**Step 1.**
 
**Co****nceptualize Your Character****:** ==Think about the character you want to create. Consider their background, personality, motivations, abilities, and appearance. I also personally ask my players what kind of narrative arc do they want to play out. Do you want to have a redemption arc or a fish out of water. This step in general is crucial for role-playing purposes, so you will want to speak to your weaver and other players to make sure what you want suits both the genre of the campaign and the party.==
 
**Step 2.**
 
**Determine** **Stat Blocks**
 
To build a character you will first need to choose a stat distribution to apply. This will determine the baseline for what your character represents physically and mentally. This should look like below but can be altered in a few ways if you are feeling spicy.
 
**The way I would personally recommend all characters be:**
 
+2, +1, 0, 0, -1
 
You will then apply this stat block to the 5 attributes previously described. Making it look a little like the below.
 
**Vig:** +2  
**Dex**: 0  
**Int**: +1  
**Att**: -1  
**Per****:** 0
 
Here we have a character with +2 vigor, +1 intellect and â€“1 attunement.  
This means generally that they will be better with feats of physical aptitude and things of a studious nature, but might miss the more natural aspects of the world.  
Note that I said generally, attributes are there to give a mechanical reason for how your PC excels or is flawed in certain aspects of their character, but don't let it define them. You can have +2 vigor and still be a halfling, as much as you can be a Wiley orc who loves books and nature.
 
**Step 2.5**
 
If you know you want to command magic feel free to assign yourself a casting stat. This is the Attribute you will roll with when casting spells so it is recommended to at least have a +1 in your chosen stat. It has to be one of the "mental stats" so either Int, Att or Per. All of these will have a mechanical effect. You also do not need to decide this now. If you start as a melee fighter and want to adopt magic later in your character arc, you can choose then.
   

**Note from Reuben:** These chosen spell casting stats aren't necessarily rigid. A character can choose to be an INT/PER caster and use both domains to cast spells. However it is a bit to manage for what differentiates the two ways of casting. Simply to say, feel free to do it but warn your weaver.
    
**Step 3**
 
**Choose areas of expertise**
 
Areas of expertise are how your character interacts with the world around them. They will use these checks to learn things about the world. They have base attributes attached to them but can be modified to be rolled with other attributes. These modifications will be found in certain move trees.
 
Per point in each mental attribute, you will gain two points to spend.
 
Intellect  
Attunement

Dex: 0  
Int: +1

For example they might want to place those points into
   

These skills are the base skills available within Camaraderie.
 
However we encourage that the player adds more skills of their own.
         

OK OK OK OK OK
 
Need to do math on how xp and character levels work.
