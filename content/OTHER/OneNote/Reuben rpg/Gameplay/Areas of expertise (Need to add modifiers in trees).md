==Notice how your skills are reflected in their current attribute rank.==  
==Because our character has +2 Vigor, it is reflected in having +2 Athletics.==  
==Similarly, because the character has -1 Attunement, their areas of expertise in that attribute are lower. But fear not, as this can be changed.==  
==For each point in a mental stat (Intellect, Attunement, and Persona), you will gain 2 points to spend in your areas of expertise. So, if our character has +1 Intellect, it means they have 2 expertise points to spend in any field.==

Above we have allocated those points into both medicine and perception, bringing them both up 1 point.  
These areas of expertise can also be increased through spending XP (Experience Points) up to a maximum cap of +6. As your character gains more experience and grows stronger, they can allocate XP to further enhance their skills and improve their areas of expertise.  
It's important to note that some skills may also change attributes based on the skills you acquire in your skill trees. This means that certain abilities or talents can modify the attribute associated with a specific area of expertise, allowing you to use a different attribute for the roll.  
For example, let's consider the skill of Intimidation. Intimidation is naturally a Persona area of expertise, meaning that it typically relies on the character's force of personality and ability to project dominance or instill fear in others. However, let's say your character acquires the "Intimidating Shout" ability. This ability grants them the power to unleash a terrifying roar that can shake the resolve of their foes.  
With the acquisition of the Intimidating Shout ability, your character gains the option to use Vigor instead of Persona for the roll when attempting to intimidate others. This means that their physical strength and imposing presence can now be utilized to intimidate others effectively.  
Remember, as you progress and gain new abilities, it's essential to consider how they can modify the attributes and areas of expertise associated with specific skills, opening up new possibilities and playstyles for your character.
