**Post Binding test results.**
 
Binding of O.O.P occurred at T1300 as a result of primary action from Parautiliatrian P3. The object in question possessed ----- Qualities, taking the shape of a small stone sundial. Archeology reports date the object to the 13th Century Peru. How it got to ---- is beyond me, but P.I.T agents recall some form of psychic chatter occurring originating from the sundial during transport. First log of this occurred during transport at -----. Overall binding success – p3 is under lock and key until safety analysis can be conducted. They are being held in --- sector until --- gives the all clear.
   

**How to get to the Solarium.**
 
- No help from p.i.t.
- Tug boat? Requires research from crazy fisher man of left shores edge, through the forest. (library then man)
- Can try find an O.O.P that will get them there.
- Maybe the tunnels from the living house.

He was placed into the solarium program to train him as the new director of P.I.T.  
He was declined for the position at 14, when during testing he lashed out a researchers and turned the old prime candidate wing into a place of power. It is now off limits and being tested.
