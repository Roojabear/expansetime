**History of Domain.**   **Planet –** Domain – or The Domain.  

- Domain is currently in its 656th year.
- Its foundation myth surrounds that of the three godlike figures that inhabit the world. 
_It is said they was a singular shooting star that was tired of their trek across the galaxy and in an effort to plant roots they founded the world of Domain to share with subjects._  
_However, upon creation something was lost, their singular will split into three with each laying claim to the power lost to the other two._  
_From this conflict kith were born, as no god wished to destroy their new world, they instead had subjects to fight wars for them._  
_Since then, an eternal war has been waged as none can best the other,_  
_None of their magics may harm the other, therefore it is prophesied that a kith must slay the gods._  
_The Sire lays claim, as they were the first born of the star. The eldest and truest Overlord that was usurped by the other two in an act of accident during the creation of Domain. They Consider themselves the shooting star that fell and shattered, one that needs to be reforged._  
**Since then**

- The world has been a mixture of war and peace.
- As the Gods cannot harm one another, they send armies to war for them.
- They also refuse to obliterate other lands as they fear retaliation will occur.
- Therefore, there is a sort of purgatory that is occurring as they wish to dispose of one another but cannot.

**The** **Living gods.**  
**The Sire.**

- The eldest of the Overlords.
- No one knows what they are in truth, but they are referred to as a vampire, due to the nature of the court and proceedings there within.
- They are very rarely seen but depictions have them pinned as an androgynous figure with long golden hair that reaches the floor, Amber eyes and the most radiant face in the world, notable no fangs.
- They are who you serve.
- Literature surrounding them suggests sacrifice as a form of worship. 
**Octavian Aurum, The God of Gold (golden god)**
 - Said to be the second Overlord.
- He is seen much more often that the other two Gods and often holds public gathers in his name.
- He feasts upon the gold that his followers give to him as a form of worship.
