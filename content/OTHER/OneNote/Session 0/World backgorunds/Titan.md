**History.**  
**General**
 
- Titan holds a unique connection to the traditional pantheon of gods, as some are born with the physical and magical attributes of a select god. - These people are called **God- woken.** - They are often approached with caution due to their overwhelming power and mythical qualities. - Titan also has recently discovered **Biomancy,** a technology/magic system that harnesses and uses souls as its fuel.
- This has led to increased tensions globally due to the dangers of this technology.
      

- The planet as a whole is recovering from a recent Inquisition, and the powers at play are struggling to fill the power void that remains in wake of the tragedy.
    
**Timanhy**
 
- A Religious state that as of current, is in the worst state it has been in since its genesis as a country.
- Worshiping Pelor, those within are often followers of his holy precepts.
- The country is still recovering from losing a war against a united coalition, after Timnahy, under military leadership, perpetrated a holy inquisition against the **God-woken** of other denominations and any country that harbored them.
- Currently they are under military occupation from Shorati and are seeking to distance themselves from the events of the past.
         

olethyr who is highly militaristic country that is still at war with the Grand dutchy of scand, is sick of the bullshit and will invade both of its neighbours in an attempt to hold peace once and for all. They believe in strength of human will and don’t believe the gods necessary but a useful tool none the less.  
Khola a scientific state that rejects religion believing in the uses for this
 
**Scgand**
 
- Queen Vera del Principi – Queen of Scgand
- Piranesi Principi – King of Scgand
- Fedror – Advisor to international relations of Scgand.
- Deidre – Royal Protector of the Throne.
 
- Overall your closest allies but are currently having a hard time forming an official alliance, due to the kings rather sporadic nature and Shoratis refusal to allow him to rule any longer.  
**Timahny**
 
- Aiydon Frax – High Justiciar and current holder of the Pillar of Light
- Samantha Hunn – Pontifex of Pelor and Holy Swan mother.
 
- Still recovering from the Pelaian inquistion, many are starving and the council of light are working to repair as much as possible, shorati have been sending aid and peacekeeping.  
**Khola**
 
- You only know of the Biomantic Board, a collective group of scholars who are researching Biomancy and control Khola loosely through each cities acadamy, that draft laws regionally.
 
- No formal talks are ongoing with khola due to their absence from the war.
 
**Tribes of the North/Olothyr**
 
- Have recently entered talks to keep them out of the waters surrounding Shoratis eastern coast and islands, trade is not an option.
