**Angelic Mights.**
 
Because angels are extra planar beings, to remain upon Golarian the commanders must possess might's, things that let them and their army's remain.  
Should Mathais reach his father he will recover his angelic might before being banished, it has not occurred instantly due to being a Demi god and serve as the figurehead.

How do you enter the city? - large walls that are patrolled. (could use main force, sewers, river)  
Avoid patrols.
 
Reach the keep.
